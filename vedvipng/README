vedvipng
******

The program in this directory (visualequation/ve-dvipng) is a modification of dvipng
1.17 to support some functionalities of visualequation and is not inteded to be used 
directly by the final user, only indirectly through visualequation. It has been named 
vedvipng to state that it is not exactly dvipng but a slightly modified version.

Not modified files have been left intact. Modified files include visualequation license
notice above original dvipng one.

To install it manually (should be documented better in next releases of
visualequation), read the INSTALL file. Basically, provided that you have 
dependencies correctly installed:

    ./configure

or

   ./configure --prefix=/some/path

and

   make
   make install
