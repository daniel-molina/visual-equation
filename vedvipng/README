vedvipng
******

The program in this directory (visualequation/ve-dvipng) is a modification of
dvipng 1.17 to support some functionalities of visualequation. It has been 
named vedvipng to state that it is based in dvipng but it is not identical,
but a slightly modified.

Not modified files (or just modified by a few characters) preserve the original
license notice identical. Modified files include visualequation license notice 
above the original dvipng license notice.

To know the details about installation (should be documented better in next 
releases of visualequation), read the (unmodified) INSTALL file. In short, 
provided that you have the dependencies correctly installed, the following
should be enough:

    ./configure

or

   ./configure --prefix=/some/path

and

   make
   make install
